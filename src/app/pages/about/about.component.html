<p class="text-success">Kerala  officially Keralam 
 is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, 
 following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions 
 of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over
  38,863 km2 , Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by 
  Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[18] to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.[19]

The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep 
south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the 
Common Era. The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE.
The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. 
In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European 

colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949.

The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks)
